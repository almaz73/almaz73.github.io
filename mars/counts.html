            This is very difficult to do.
        </h1>

        <p>
            There is a conservation law of momentum: m1*V1 = m2*V2
        </p>
        <p>
            To change the momentum of one body, the other body must receive the same amount of momentum.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the mass of Deimos is 1.48*10^15 kg. And the orbital speed is 1.3513 km/s. It will take a lot of work to give momentum to the ejected pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's assume that in a day one machine gun can shoot 10 tons = 3.6 million kg. Each shot at a speed of 400m/s.
        </p>
        <p>
            10 tons per day is 3.65 million kg per year, and then:
        </p>
        <p>
            v1 = (3650000*400)/1480000000000000 = 0.0000009864864864864865 m/s
        </p>
        <p>
            This is how much the speed of Deimos will decrease in a million years if you shoot stones like that.
        </p>
        <p>
            And it takes 1 million years to change the speed by 1 m/s.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, we can use a million spinLauncher, then it will take a year. But in order for Deimos to fall like a stone on Mars, we need to reduce its speed by at least 200 m/s. Means even with a million SpinLuchers, it will take 200 years to achieve what you
            want.
        </p>
        <p>
            The developers say they can make a SpinLuncher with a firing speed of 8 km/s. Then one device will be able to give an impulse 20 times more than now, which they demonstrated in tests. Thus, a million upgraded spinLaunchers will have to work for 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Theoretically possible, but very expensive and difficult. Imagine how many flights it would take from Earth to Deimos to transfer a million cars. If only some kind of mineral was found on Deimos, it would be worth doing it ..
        </p>
        <p>
            Not yet achievable.
        </p>
        <p>
            But there is still one more approach for this project.

            <p>
                To be continued.
